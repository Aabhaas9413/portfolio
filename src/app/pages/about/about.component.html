          Hello! I'm a passionate developer with a strong interest in building web applications that solve real-world problems. 
          I enjoy working with modern technologies like Angular, React, and Node.js.
        </p>
        <p>
          My journey in web development started when I decided to build my own website. Since then, I've been learning and building constantly.
          I love the feeling of creating something from nothing and seeing people use it.
